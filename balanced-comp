## Step 1
Make sure to create a backup of your split file before doing this, you probably don't want to accidentally overwrite something and lose your actual PB comparison.

## Step 2
Right Click -> Edit Splits… -> Start Timer at:
Set this value a few seconds off your goal (e.g. 1:13:55 if you want a 1:13 comparison)

Select the Split Time column and delete its contents.

Right Click -> Settings -> Choose Active Comparisons… -> ✔ Balanced PB

## Step 3
Start your timer, skip to the last split and stop it exactly at the time for which you would like to create a comparison. It's obviously fine if you're a few decimals off, we can easily edit this later. Make sure to reset the timer afterwards so that it saves the time as PB.

## Step 4
Right Click -> Share… -> Excel -> Share, save the .xlsx to your desktop or something.

Open the generated .xlsx file (Good FOSS Office Suite: LibreOffice)

Scroll over to the "Balanced PB" column, copy all the numbers.

Open your splits again, Right Click -> Edit Splits… -> Add Comparison

Select the first split on your new comparison and paste everything.

Then adjust the final split time to end in .00 if you like.

Done!
